zkontract testing for the Aleo Code Sprint 2.0!

This project was built off a modified version of art-factory by demox-labs as a front-end and back-end framework. https://github.com/demox-labs/art-factory

The modified base was extracted from my forked project of art-factory zkoi. https://github.com/mikenike360/zkoi

The app is currently deployed on vercel: https://zkontractv4.vercel.app/

The current transfer function uses transfer_public to send the bounty reward to the poster. The next update to be pushed will be the transfer_private update!

Goals for the future:

1. Create and escrow contract to handle bounty payments
2. Create a reputation system for bounty posters
