zKontract developed for the Aleo Code Sprint 2.0!

Zkontract is an anoymous bounty board that allows users to hire and work anomymously. Any illegal activity will swiftly be removed by the bounty board creator who retains full access to delete any bounties. Eventually this could transfer to a DAO or the Aleo community.

This app is currently in its Alpha release. Please use at your own discretion. 

This project was built off a modified version of art-factory by demox-labs as a front-end and back-end framework. https://github.com/demox-labs/art-factory

The modified base was extracted from my forked project of art-factory zkoi. https://github.com/mikenike360/zkoi

The app is currently deployed on vercel: https://zkontractv4.vercel.app/

Goals for the future:

1. Create an escrow contract to handle bounty payments
2. Create a reputation system for bounty posters
