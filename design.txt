Revised Plan: Focus on Integration

1. Backend Priorities
Finalize the Aleo smart contract:
Ensure transitions are ready for posting bounties, listing active bounties, viewing details, and submitting proposals.
Test contract functionality thoroughly using aleo run or similar tools.

Integrate off-chain storage:
Set up S3 (or equivalent) for storing bounty descriptions and proposal details.
Add logic in the frontend to generate and manage bounty_id and proposal_id references to these off-chain details.

2. Frontend Integration
Modify your existing frontend to:

Fetch active bounty summaries:
Use a transition like list_active_bounties to retrieve public metadata (title, payment, status).

Fetch bounty details:
Call the view_bounty_details transition with a selected bounty_id to fetch metadata.
Use the bounty_id to fetch long-form descriptions from S3.

Submit proposals:
Use the submit_proposal transition to store proposal metadata on-chain.
Upload the actual proposal content to S3, referenced by proposal_id.

Key Tasks

A. Backend Integration
Smart Contract Testing:

Deploy your contract locally or on a testnet.
Use aleo run to simulate all transitions:
Posting bounties.
Fetching active bounties.
Viewing details.
Submitting proposals.

API Layer (Optional):

If needed, create a backend service to act as an intermediary between the frontend and the Aleo blockchain.
Example stack: Node.js + Express + Axios for handling blockchain and S3 requests.
